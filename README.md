# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews with JAX and Flax

This project uses JAX and Flax to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. We apply a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify reviews as either positive or negative.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task where we aim to determine the sentiment expressed in text data. This project leverages the power of JAX, a high-performance numerical computing library, and Flax, its neural networks API, to build, train, and evaluate a CNN on movie reviews.

## Setup

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install jax jaxlib flax optax tensorflow-datasets
```

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jax-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- JAX
- Flax
- Optax
- TensorFlow Datasets (for loading IMDB reviews)

## Dataset

We use the IMDB Reviews dataset from TensorFlow Datasets, which provides labeled movie reviews for binary classification.

## Model

The model architecture consists of:
- Embedding layer
- 1D Convolutional layer
- Average pooling
- Dense layers

## Training

- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy 
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Epochs:** 10 (configurable)

The training process involves iterating over the dataset, updating model parameters through backpropagation.

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, reporting the accuracy of sentiment classifications.
